# Location-Tracking-using-GPS-GSM
. A real time vehicle tracking system using the GPS technology is proposed in this paper. The project Android App based Vehicle Tracking Using GSM AND GPRS mainly focuses in tracking the location of the vehicle on which the device has been installed. It will then send the data in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates through SMS on the user’s mobile where the coordinates will be plotted in the Android app automatically. Initially, the GPS installed in the device takes input from the satellite and stores it in the microcontroller’s buffer. In order to track the vehicle, the mobile user has to call on the SIM number that is registered in the GSM module of the device. Once the call is received, the device authenticates the calling number. If authenticated, the location of the vehicle is sent to the registered mobile number in the form of SMS. After sending the message, the GSM is deactivated and the GPS is activated again. The coordinates of the location received in the SMS can be viewed on the android app. The hardware part described in the paper comprises of GPRS, GSM module, LCD to view the coordinates, ATMega Microcontroller MAX 232, Arduino, RS232 and relay.
